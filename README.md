# Grade Calculator

Created a software that calculated user entered Test Scores, which would then output the average and grade point to help users track their progress on schooling/test scores.
This was implemented using Classes, Loops, If Statements, and the Round feature.

Verified the following criteria:

- Verify negative/invalid inputs
- Verify multiple test inputs from one test score to up to hundreds of test scores
- Verify rounded average to accurately calculate the Letter Grade
- Verify at least one test score must be inputted to avoid divide by 0 scenario
